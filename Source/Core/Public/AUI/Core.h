 *
 * Note: UI widgets exist in two spaces: logical and actual.
 *       Logical screen space is used for all developer-given widget
 *       measurements, and is relative to the value of Core::logicalScreenSize.
 *       Actual screen space is what's actually used in rendering to the
 *       screen, and is relative to the value of Core::actualScreenSize.
 *
 *       The intent is that the developer will set a logical screen size and
 *       give all width, height, position, etc values in reference to that
 *       logical size. Then, the user can select a new actual size and the UI
 *       will intelligently scale to match it.
